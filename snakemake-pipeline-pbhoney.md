**_Snakemake_** (version 8.14.0) is a workflow management system and language for creating data analysis pipelines. It is designed to handle complex workflows involving multiple steps, dependencies, and data files in a reproducible and scalable manner. Snakemake allows users to define rules that specify how to generate output files from input files, and it automatically determines the order of execution based on these rules, ensuring that each step is executed only when its dependencies are met. It supports parallel execution and integration with cluster and cloud environments.
